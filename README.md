# my-configs
A smattering of configuration files I use for common programs like bash, vim, etc. The contents of these files are subject to change according to my preferences.

Currently included are:
* `./.alias`: Contains alias files for various specific scenarios, like different Linux distros.
* `.bash_aliases`: Contains the most common aliases I use across UNIX-like systems.
* `.bash_profile`: Commands run whenever one logs in.
* `.bash_prompt`: The prompt used (changes to scary red for the root user)
* `.bashrc`: Commands run at every interactive session.
* `.vimrc`: Presets for vim (sets tabstops, line numbers, syntax highlighting, and colors)
